My first javascript project from scratch.

This game will be played entirely in the console, by a human player, against the computer.

The game will keep players' score. The  game will be played round by round, for  5 round and the winner will be declared at the end. 

First, I  will write a function that randomly returns the result of  “rock”, “paper” or “scissors” from the computer.

Then, I  will write a function that takes the human's choice and returns it. 

Then, I will write variables to keep track of the players score.
 
Then, I will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.

Last, I will  write a function  that calls the game  to play for 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end.
