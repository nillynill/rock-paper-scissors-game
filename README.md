REVISITING ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME:

Add a basic UI to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game (previously coded to be played on the console)

In UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.

Remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.

Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (Keep the console.logs for this step)

Add a div for displaying results and change all of console.logs into DOM methods.

Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.

Refactor (rework/rewrite) the original code to make it work for this.  Reworking old code is an important part of a programmerâ€™s life!
